# Menstural_Chart--project
 The spectrum of a woman's menstrual cycle tells an important story about her fertility and her general well-being. This project helped to reveal the patterns hidden in her monthly cycle and her biological clock. Working on this project helped me experience first-hand how health data and the insights derived thereof can be used to  manage client's health for improved outcomes.
 
# Documentation
This was a seven-year chart of a mature womanâ€™s menstrual cycle who is currently in her mid-40s. The information was retrieved from a personal diary and documented in Excel to come up with an electronic copy for subsequent  data manipulation and 
analysis was done. The information was carefully interpreted for transcription and data entry into Excel to ensure data accuracy. An interview was done with this client to obtain more information about her menstrual cycle and the associated symptoms.
The client's consent was sought and obtained before proceeding to document and publish records. Data has been anonymized to ensure compliance with health records protection and privacy.
# Key Insights
The following were the insights derived.
There was a gradual shortening of the menstrual cycle and consequently a shortening of the ovulation day.
It was also observed that as the cycle got shorter, the occurrence of  having 2  menstrual periods in a month within a year increased hence, she recorded more than 12 periods in a year as she got older. 
She experienced her monthly period without fail.
She observed a shortening in duration of flow.
She observed heavier flow, slightly painful with no clots.
There were a few months in each year where the cycle was longer than usual.
The above findings were consistent with the perimenopausal stage in older woman as the ovary's production of estrogen and progesterone begins to decline.

# Recommendations
A large-scale health data analytics of women's monthly cycle records on different apps, health institutions should be explored to better inform us about the modern-day woman and her fertility profile.

# Limitations
This project was limited to one individual as such the findings are only restricted to her.
